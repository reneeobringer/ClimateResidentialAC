Code and data for an analysis of air conditioning use for 75 households across three US cities (Austin, TX, Ithaca, NY, and San Diego, CA). The results from the analysis are under review. 

The code was developed in R version 4.0.2 and last ran on 18 October 2022.

Two categories of data were collected: air conditioning data and climate data. The air conditioning data were collected from Pecan Street, Inc. Dataport (https://www.pecanstreet.org/dataport/) and are not included in this repository. Interested parties are encouraged to reach out to Peacn Street, Inc. for access. The climate data (folder: 'ClimateData') were obtained from the National Centers for Environmental Information, which maintains a database of weather station data. All data were collected in 2022.
